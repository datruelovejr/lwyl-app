## **name: lwyl-ux-engagement description: Layered user engagement architecture for the Love Where You Lead (LWYL) app and BTCG consulting experience. Use when building, modifying, or reviewing any LWYL app feature, designing the user journey, planning Tier 1 or Tier 2 experiences, or when Daniel needs client-facing language about why the LWYL experience creates lasting transformation. Triggers include "build a feature," "design the onboarding," "create the Tier 2 journey," "how should this screen work," "what should happen when," "explain why LWYL works," or any request involving user experience, retention, engagement, or app interaction design for Love Where You Lead. Also triggers when Daniel asks for language to describe the LWYL experience to prospects, partners, or in content.**

# **LWYL Engagement Architecture**

The Love Where You Lead app is not a dashboard. It is a behavioral transformation system. Every screen, interaction, notification, and transition must be engineered to make leaders return, reflect, and grow — not because they're told to, but because the experience itself pulls them back.

This skill provides the engagement operating system for every LWYL decision. It layers five proven behavioral frameworks into a unified architecture that guides both app development and client-facing positioning.

## **The Core Principle**

**Engagement is not a feature you add. It is the architecture you build on.**

The most successful digital products (Duolingo: 40M+ DAUs, Peloton: 92-96% retention, Headspace: 70M+ downloads) don't bolt engagement onto finished products. They build every interaction around behavioral science from the foundation up.

LWYL must do the same. The assessment data is the engine. The engagement architecture is what keeps leaders in the driver's seat.

---

## **THE FIVE ENGAGEMENT LAYERS**

Every LWYL feature, screen, and interaction must be evaluated against all five layers. Not every feature activates all five, but every feature should consciously activate at least two.

### **Layer 1: Habit Loop (Getting Leaders to Return)**

**Based on:** Nir Eyal's Hook Model, BJ Fogg's B=MAP, James Clear's Atomic Habits

**The principle:** Behavior happens when Motivation \+ Ability \+ Prompt converge. Habits form through repeating the cycle: Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment. Start with actions so tiny they require almost no motivation.

**LWYL Application Rules:**

**Triggers — What brings them back:**

* Internal trigger (goal state): The feeling of "I wonder what's going on with my team" — LWYL should become the place leaders go when they feel uncertain about team dynamics  
* External triggers: Weekly insight notification timed to Monday mornings (before the week's first team interaction), session prep reminders before scheduled 1-on-1s  
* Trigger timing matters more than trigger content — prompt leaders when the behavioral context matches (before meetings, after difficult conversations, start of week/month/quarter)

**Action — Make the smallest step effortless:**

* Every app open should deliver value in under 60 seconds  
* The default view should surface one actionable insight without requiring navigation  
* Tier 2 weekly modules should start with a 2-minute reflection, not a 15-minute video  
* Apply the Two-Minute Rule: if the first action takes more than 2 minutes, it's too heavy

**Variable Reward — Surprise them with relevance:**

* Rotate which team insight surfaces first (don't show the same DISC overview every time)  
* Deliver periodic "Did you know?" behavioral insights personalized to their specific team composition  
* Surface pattern connections they haven't seen: "3 of your 5 team members share the same Values driver — here's what that means for Monday's meeting"  
* Variable rewards must feel *useful*, not gimmicky — leadership context demands substance over dopamine hits

**Investment — Make leaving costly:**

* Every note a leader saves, every Connection Agreement drafted, every reflection written increases stored value  
* Track and display journey progress visibly (endowed progress effect)  
* Team relationship history becomes an irreplaceable asset over time  
* The more a leader customizes their dashboard, the more they own it (IKEA Effect)

**Development checklist for any new feature:**

* \[ \] What triggers a leader to use this feature? (Internal emotion or external prompt?)  
* \[ \] Can the core action be completed in under 2 minutes?  
* \[ \] Does the feature deliver something slightly different or surprising each time?  
* \[ \] Does using this feature create stored value that makes the app more valuable next time?

---

### **Layer 2: Motivation Design (Making It Feel Worth It)**

**Based on:** Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan), Dan Pink's Drive, Flow State Theory (Csikszentmihalyi)

**The principle:** Sustained intrinsic motivation requires three psychological needs: Autonomy (I choose this), Competence (I'm getting better at this), and Relatedness (This connects me to others). When all three are met, engagement sustains itself without external pressure.

**LWYL Application Rules:**

**Autonomy — Leaders must feel in control:**

* Never force a linear path through the dashboard — let leaders explore what interests them  
* Tier 2 weekly modules should have a recommended sequence but allow self-directed exploration  
* Let leaders choose which team dynamics to examine first  
* Offer reflection prompts as invitations, not requirements: "If you're ready..." not "You must complete..."  
* Let leaders set their own engagement cadence: daily insight vs. weekly deep-dive vs. session-only  
* NEVER make the app feel like homework assigned by a consultant

**Competence — Leaders must feel themselves growing:**

* Every interaction should leave them knowing something they didn't before  
* Progress indicators must reflect genuine capability growth, not just task completion  
* Use language that names what they've learned: "You now understand your team's dominant decision-making style" — not "Module 2 complete"  
* Tier 2 weekly modules should progressively increase in complexity (Flow channel):  
  * Week 1: Understand YOUR profile (effortless — they already know themselves)  
  * Week 2: Understand your TEAM's profile (moderate — new data, familiar context)  
  * Week 3: See the GAP between you and your team (challenging — confronts assumptions)  
  * Week 4: BUILD THE BRIDGE with Connection Agreements (mastery — applying everything)  
* Celebrate insight milestones, not activity milestones

**Relatedness — Leaders must feel connected to something larger:**

* Frame every insight in terms of its impact on real people: "Your High S team members need X" — not "The S dimension indicates..."  
* The Tier 2 journey should feel like a conversation with a mentor, not a course module  
* Connection Agreements are inherently relational — position them as acts of care, not management tools  
* Surface moments that connect the leader's growth to their team's experience: "When you adjust your approach here, your team feels seen"

**Development checklist for any new feature:**

* \[ \] Does this feature give leaders a choice about how/when/what to engage with?  
* \[ \] Does using this feature make the leader feel more capable as a leader?  
* \[ \] Does this feature connect the leader to their team's experience or growth?

---

### **Layer 3: Behavioral Mechanics (The Invisible Architecture)**

**Based on:** Loss Aversion, Endowed Progress Effect, Zeigarnik Effect, Commitment & Consistency, Goal Gradient Effect, Social Comparison Theory

**The principle:** Specific behavioral mechanics create persistent engagement patterns. These should be designed into the system architecture, not added as surface features. They work best when invisible — the leader shouldn't feel "gamified," they should feel *compelled*.

**LWYL Application Rules:**

**Endowed Progress — Start them ahead:**

* When a leader completes their ADVanced Insights assessment, they arrive in the app with visible progress already banked: "Step 1 of 4 complete — Your leadership profile is ready"  
* Never start at 0%. The assessment IS the first step. Show it.  
* Tier 2 users should see their profile data pre-loaded as evidence of progress: "You've already uncovered your Preference, Passion, and Process. Now let's put it to work."  
* This single mechanic increases completion rates by up to 80% (Nunes & Drèze car wash study)

**Loss Aversion — Make progress feel precious:**

* "Leadership Growth Journey" tracking should show accumulated insights and reflections  
* Frame continuity as something to protect: "You've invested 3 weeks in understanding your team — Week 4 brings it all together"  
* If a leader goes inactive, re-engagement should reference what they've built, not what they're missing: "Your team insights are waiting — including 2 new patterns since your last visit"  
* Streak mechanics should be SUBTLE in a leadership context — track "consecutive weeks of reflection" but frame it as growth evidence, not a game

**Zeigarnik Effect — Leave open loops:**

* Each Tier 2 weekly module must end with a compelling preview of next week's insight  
* Use open questions that create genuine curiosity: "Next week, you'll see why your strongest team member might be your biggest friction point"  
* Partially revealed data creates pull: "Your team has one Values alignment that's nearly perfect — and one that explains most of your tension. Week 3 reveals both."  
* Never close all loops in a single session — always leave one thread pulling toward return

**Commitment & Consistency — Get micro-commitments early:**

* During onboarding, ask leaders to state their intention: "What do you most want to understand about your team?" — their own words become an internal commitment  
* Connection Agreements are powerful commitment devices — once documented, leaders feel obligated to honor them  
* Weekly reflection prompts that ask "What will you do differently this week?" create implementation intentions  
* Small public commitments (even sharing one insight with a colleague) dramatically increase follow-through

**Goal Gradient Effect — Accelerate near the finish:**

* Progress bars in Tier 2 should feel like they accelerate in the final week  
* Surface "you're almost there" language when leaders are 75%+ through any sequence  
* The final module of any journey should feel like a culmination, not just another step

**Social Comparison (use carefully):**

* In organizational deployments, aggregate benchmarks can be powerful: "Leaders who complete all 4 weeks report 60% less team friction"  
* Peer comparison should be aspirational, not competitive: "Other leaders with similar team compositions found that..."  
* NEVER create leaderboards in a leadership development context — the dynamic is wrong  
* DO surface social proof: "47 leaders have completed this journey" (validation, not competition)

**Development checklist for any new feature:**

* \[ \] Does the feature show progress already earned? (Endowed Progress)  
* \[ \] Does the feature create something the leader would feel loss about abandoning? (Loss Aversion)  
* \[ \] Does the feature leave an open loop that pulls toward return? (Zeigarnik)  
* \[ \] Does the feature invite a micro-commitment? (Commitment & Consistency)  
* \[ \] Does the feature accelerate momentum near completion? (Goal Gradient)

### **Layer 4: Experience Design (Making Each Session Transformative)**

**Based on:** Peak-End Rule (Kahneman), Power of Moments (Heath & Heath), Kano Model, Joey Coleman's First 100 Days

**The principle:** People judge experiences based on the most emotionally intense moment (peak) and the final moment (end) — not the average. Invest disproportionately in creating breakthrough moments and powerful endings rather than smoothing everything to mediocre consistency.

**LWYL Application Rules:**

**Peak-End Rule — Engineer the highlights and the close:**

* Every Tier 2 weekly module must have ONE designed peak moment — the "aha" where the leader sees something they've never seen before about their team  
* The end of every app session should leave the leader feeling more capable, not more overwhelmed  
* Peak moments in LWYL:  
  * First time seeing the team DISC distribution → "Oh. I lead a High S team and I'm a High D/I."  
  * First time seeing the Leader-to-Team gap → "That's why they don't respond to my energy."  
  * First Connection Agreement drafted → "I've never documented how to work with someone before."  
  * Environment Report insights → "I didn't know I needed that until I saw it."  
* Endings in LWYL:  
  * Close each session with a single, memorable insight statement (not a summary list)  
  * Tier 2 weekly modules should end with a reflection that names their growth  
  * The final Tier 2 module should close with a moment of genuine pride

**Power of Moments — Engineer EPIC moments:** Every Tier 2 week should contain at least one EPIC element:

* **E — Elevation:** Break the script. Surprise them. The first time the dashboard visualizes their team in ways they've never seen counts as elevation.  
* **P — Pride:** Mark milestones with genuine recognition. "You've now built a deeper understanding of your team than most leaders achieve in years."  
* **I — Insight:** The "aha" that rewires understanding. The Leader-to-Team comparison IS an insight moment — design the reveal to land emotionally, not just informationally.  
* **C — Connection:** Deepen relationships. Connection Agreements are connection moments by design. Frame them as acts of care, not management protocols.

**EPIC moments mapped to the Tier 2 journey:**

* Week 1 PEAK: Elevation — Seeing your own profile through the LWYL lens for the first time  
* Week 2 PEAK: Insight — Seeing your team's aggregate composition and realizing what they actually need  
* Week 3 PEAK: Insight \+ Connection — The gap reveal. "Do you love the place you lead, or do you love that you're the leader?"  
* Week 4 PEAK: Pride \+ Connection — Completing the first Connection Agreement. The bridge is built.

**Kano Model — Know which features delight vs. which are expected:**

* Must-Be features (absence \= frustration, presence \= neutral): Assessment data loads correctly, profiles display accurately, saved data persists between sessions  
* Performance features (better execution \= higher satisfaction): Speed of insight delivery, clarity of visualizations, depth of interpretive content  
* Delighter features (unexpected \= delight): Personalized behavioral insights the leader didn't ask for, "Did you know?" moments about their specific team composition, contextual tips tied to their actual gaps  
* Today's delighter becomes tomorrow's expectation — continuously innovate on surprise

**Coleman's First 100 Days — Map the emotional lifecycle:** The gap between consulting session and sustained app use is where most engagement dies. Map it explicitly:

| Phase | LWYL Moment | Engagement Risk | Design Response |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Assess | Leader evaluates BTCG | "Is this real?" | Social proof, diagnostic question hook |
| Admit | Leader commits to engagement | "Did I make the right call?" | Immediate value confirmation |
| **Affirm** | Post-purchase doubt sets in | "What did I actually buy?" | Welcome sequence with instant app access |
| Activate | First app interaction | "Is this worth my time?" | Deliver ONE insight in under 60 seconds |
| Acclimate | Learning the app | "This is a lot" | Progressive disclosure, guided first visit |
| Accomplish | Leader sees first team insight | "THIS is what I needed" | Engineer this as the peak moment |
| Adopt | Regular app use | "This is part of how I lead" | Habit loops sustain this phase |
| Advocate | Leader tells others | "You need to try this" | Make sharing easy, provide language |

**The Affirm phase is the highest-risk moment.** Between paying for BTCG and experiencing the app, doubt lives. The fix: leaders should have app access within 24 hours of engagement start, with their own profile pre-loaded and a personalized welcome that references their specific assessment results.

**Development checklist for any new feature:**

* \[ \] Does this feature contain a designed peak moment?  
* \[ \] Does this feature end on a high note?  
* \[ \] Is this feature a Must-Be, Performance, or Delighter? (And are we investing accordingly?)  
* \[ \] Where does this feature fall in the First 100 Days lifecycle?

### **Layer 5: Service Design (The Human Architecture Around the App)**

**Based on:** Disney Guest Experience, Ritz-Carlton Gold Standards, Service Profit Chain, Zappos Culture, Apple Steps of Service

**The principle:** The app doesn't exist in isolation. It lives inside a consulting relationship. The human experience around the app — how Daniel introduces it, how sessions reference it, how follow-up feels — determines whether the app becomes a living tool or a forgotten tab.

**LWYL Application Rules:**

**Disney's "Bumping the Lamp" — Obsess over details they won't consciously notice:**

* Loading states should feel intentional, not broken (progress messages during data loading: "Building your team profile..." not a spinning wheel)  
* Micro-copy matters: "Your team" not "The team." "Your leadership style" not "DISC profile."  
* Color choices, typography, and spacing should feel calm and confident — this is a leadership tool, not a consumer app  
* Error states should feel human: "Something went sideways. We're on it." not "Error 500"  
* The details people don't consciously notice are the ones they feel when they're missing

**Ritz-Carlton Empowerment — Listen carefully, respond creatively:**

* The app should feel like it's listening — surface insights that respond to what the leader has already explored  
* If a leader spends time on a specific team member's profile, surface related insights in their next session  
* Daniel's consulting sessions should reference what the leader has done in the app: "I see you've been looking at the Values gap with your operations team — let's dig into that"  
* The app and the consulting relationship should feel like ONE continuous experience, not separate channels

**Service Profit Chain — Daniel's energy drives leader engagement:**

* Leaders who feel Daniel's genuine investment in their growth will invest more in the app  
* The app should reinforce Daniel's voice and philosophy — leaders should feel his presence even when using the app alone  
* Interpretive content should sound like Daniel, not like a textbook  
* This means the LWYL language layer isn't just branding — it's the emotional connective tissue between consulting sessions

**Apple Steps of Service — Every interaction follows a human arc:**

* **Approach:** The app's first impression should feel warm and confident, not clinical  
* **Probe:** Before delivering insights, understand what the leader cares about (onboarding questions)  
* **Present:** Deliver insights in the order of emotional impact, not data hierarchy  
* **Listen:** Create space for leader reflection (don't fill every screen with content)  
* **End:** Every session closes with a single empowering statement, not a data dump

**Development checklist for any new feature:**

* \[ \] Does this feature feel like it came from a team that obsesses over details?  
* \[ \] Does this feature respond to what the leader has already done or shown interest in?  
* \[ \] Does this feature reinforce Daniel's voice and BTCG philosophy?  
* \[ \] Does this feature follow the human arc: approach, understand, deliver, reflect, close?

---

## **CLIENT-FACING LANGUAGE GUIDE**

When Daniel needs to describe the LWYL experience to prospects, partners, or in content, use these frameworks to articulate WHY the experience works — without naming the behavioral science behind it.

### **The Transformation Narrative**

**What leaders experience (the language Daniel uses):**

"Most leadership tools give you a report and say 'good luck.' Love Where You Lead gives you a living system. Your team's behavioral data isn't sitting in a PDF somewhere — it's in your pocket, surfacing the exact insight you need before your next meeting, your next hard conversation, your next hiring decision."

"The app doesn't just show you data. It shows you what that data means for THIS team member, THIS dynamic, THIS friction point. And it grows with you — the more you use it, the sharper the insights become."

"We designed the experience so that every time you open it, you learn something you didn't know about the people you lead. Not theory. Not generic advice. Specific, personal, actionable intelligence about YOUR team."

### **Positioning Language by Audience**

**For organizational buyers (Tier 1):**

* "Your leaders get a team intelligence dashboard they've never had access to before — and it doesn't just sit there. It actively surfaces the insights that matter most for how they lead this week."  
* "The assessment creates the foundation. The app turns that foundation into daily leadership intelligence."  
* "Other programs give you a workshop and hope. We give you a system that keeps working long after the facilitator leaves the room."

**For individual leaders (Tier 2):**

* "This isn't a course you complete and forget. It's a 4-week journey that fundamentally changes how you see the people around you — and how you lead them."  
* "Each week builds on the last. By Week 4, you'll have built something most leaders never create: a documented understanding of exactly how to lead YOUR specific team."  
* "The insights you'll uncover aren't generic. They're based on YOUR behavioral profile, YOUR team's composition, and the specific gaps between how you lead and what they need."

**For partners and referral sources:**

* "Love Where You Lead is where behavioral assessment meets ongoing leadership practice. The assessment is the beginning, not the deliverable."  
* "Leaders who go through LWYL don't just learn about their team — they build Connection Agreements that change how they show up every day. Their team members feel the difference. Those team members become the next wave of referrals."

### **Language to Avoid**

* "Assessment tool" → Say "leadership intelligence system"  
* "Dashboard" → Say "team insight view" or "your leadership lens"  
* "Module" or "course" → Say "your leadership journey" or "weekly deep-dive"  
* "Data" without context → Always pair data with human impact: "the data reveals how your team actually experiences your leadership"  
* "Gamification" → NEVER use this word. The mechanics are invisible. The experience is genuine.  
* "Engagement features" → Say "the experience is designed to grow with you"  
* "Retention" → Say "leaders keep coming back because the insights keep getting sharper"

### **The Experience Differentiator (Daniel's Pitch Language)**

"Here's what makes Love Where You Lead different from every other leadership program out there:

Most programs give you a personality assessment, a half-day workshop, and a PDF report. Six months later, you can't even find the report.

LWYL gives you a living system. Your team's behavioral data lives in an app that surfaces personalized insights every time you open it. Not generic tips. Specific intelligence about YOUR team — who needs more autonomy, who needs more structure, where the friction lives, and exactly how to bridge it.

And it's not just a tool you look at. It's a journey you go through. Four weeks. Each one builds. By the end, you've built Connection Agreements with your team that document how you're going to lead differently — not based on theory, but based on the actual behavioral science of who they are.

That's why leaders keep coming back to it. Not because we remind them. Because the insights are too valuable to ignore."

---

## **FEATURE DECISION FRAMEWORK**

When building or modifying any LWYL feature, run it through this rapid evaluation:

### **The 5-Layer Quick Check**

For any proposed feature, answer these five questions:

1. **HABIT:** Does this feature have a trigger, a simple action, a reward, and an investment? If not, how will leaders ever use it more than once?

2. **MOTIVATION:** Does this feature satisfy autonomy (they choose it), competence (they grow from it), or relatedness (it connects them to others)? If none, why would they care?

3. **BEHAVIORAL:** Does this feature leverage at least one: endowed progress, loss aversion, open loops, micro-commitments, or goal gradient? If not, what sustains engagement?

4. **EXPERIENCE:** Does this feature contain a designed peak moment? Does it end well? Where does it sit in the First 100 Days lifecycle?

5. **SERVICE:** Does this feature feel like it came from a team that obsesses over details? Does it reinforce Daniel's voice?

### **Priority Scoring**

When choosing between features to build, score each on:

| Criteria | Weight | Question |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Activation Impact | 30% | Does this get a new leader to their first "aha" faster? |
| Return Frequency | 25% | Does this give leaders a reason to open the app this week? |
| Depth of Engagement | 20% | Does this create stored value that increases over time? |
| Emotional Peak | 15% | Does this contain a moment the leader will remember and share? |
| Referral Potential | 10% | Will a leader tell someone about this specific feature? |

### **The "Would They Miss It?" Test**

Before shipping any feature, ask: "If we removed this feature after a leader had used it for 30 days, would they notice? Would they complain?" If the answer is no, the feature isn't creating enough value to justify its existence.

---

## **ONBOARDING ARCHITECTURE**

The first 5 minutes in the LWYL app determine whether a leader becomes a regular user or a one-time visitor. Design onboarding as a Peak-End experience, not a tutorial.

### **First Open Sequence**

**Second 0-10: Recognition** "Welcome, \[Name\]. Your Love Where You Lead profile is ready." → Their name. Their data. Immediately personal.

**Second 10-30: Endowed Progress** "You've already completed Step 1: Your leadership assessment revealed your Preference, Passion, and Process. Let's put that to work." → They didn't start at zero. They started ahead.

**Second 30-60: First Insight (The Hook)** Surface ONE surprising insight from their own profile — something they might not have noticed in the PDF report: "Your top Values driver is \[X\]. Only 12% of leaders share this driver — here's what that means for how you experience your team." → Variable reward. Personalized. Unexpected.

**Minute 1-2: Micro-Commitment** "What matters most to you right now as a leader?"

* \[ \] Understanding why certain team relationships feel harder  
* \[ \] Getting better at one-on-ones  
* \[ \] Building a team environment where people thrive  
* \[ \] Reducing the friction that's draining my energy → Their answer becomes an internal commitment. It also personalizes what the app surfaces next.

**Minute 2-5: The Team Reveal (Peak Moment)** If team data is available: Show the team DISC distribution with a single interpretive sentence. "You lead a team with 60% High S members. You're a High D/I. That gap is where most of your friction lives — and it's not anyone's fault." → This is the peak. This is the moment they remember. Design it to land emotionally.

If team data is NOT yet available: Show what's coming. "Once your team completes their assessments, you'll see your team like you've never seen them before — their strengths, their needs, and the specific gaps between how you lead and what they need." → Zeigarnik open loop. They'll check back.

**End: Empowering close** "You're already further than most leaders ever get. The fact that you're here means you care about the people you lead. Let's make sure they feel it." → Peak-End Rule. The close is emotional, not informational.

---

## **TIER 2 INDIVIDUAL JOURNEY — ENGAGEMENT MAP**

Each week of the 4-week Tier 2 journey must follow this engagement rhythm:

### **Weekly Module Structure**

**Opening (2 minutes): The Return Hook**

* Welcome back with progress recognition  
* Reference their previous week's reflection or commitment  
* Surface one new insight to reward their return

**Core Content (10-15 minutes): The Deep Dive**

* Daniel's video content (warm, vulnerable, mentor-voice)  
* Interactive data exploration tied to their own profile  
* Guided reflection questions that create commitment

**The Peak (designed moment): The "Aha"**

* Each week has ONE designed breakthrough moment  
* This is the moment they'll tell someone about  
* It should feel like seeing something for the first time

**The Bridge Challenge (5 minutes): The Action Step**

* One specific thing to try THIS WEEK with their team  
* Small enough to actually do (Fogg's Tiny Habits)  
* Document what happened (investment \+ commitment)

**The Close (1 minute): The Open Loop**

* Celebrate what they learned this week (Pride moment)  
* Preview next week's insight with a compelling question (Zeigarnik)  
* Single empowering statement (Peak-End close)

### **Week-by-Week Engagement Design**

**Week 1: "Who You Really Are"**

* Flow difficulty: Easy (they already know themselves)  
* EPIC element: Elevation — Seeing themselves through the LWYL lens  
* Peak moment: Their profile reframed as leadership intelligence, not just personality  
* Open loop: "Next week, you'll see your team through this same lens — and the picture might surprise you."  
* Behavioral mechanic: Endowed progress (assessment \= Step 1 done)

**Week 2: "Who They Really Are"**

* Flow difficulty: Moderate (new data, familiar context)  
* EPIC element: Insight — Team composition reveals patterns they sensed but couldn't name  
* Peak moment: Team aggregate visualization with interpretive insight  
* Open loop: "Now you know who they are. Next week, you'll see the gap between who you are and what they need."  
* Behavioral mechanic: Investment (saved team notes), Curiosity (partially revealed gap data)

**Week 3: "The Gap Between You"**

* Flow difficulty: Challenging (confronts assumptions about their leadership)  
* EPIC element: Insight \+ Connection — The gap reveal forces the mirror question  
* Peak moment: Leader-to-Team comparison with the LWYL diagnostic: "Do you love the place you lead, or do you love that you're the leader?"  
* Open loop: "The gap isn't the problem. It's the opportunity. Next week, you build the bridge."  
* Behavioral mechanic: Loss aversion (3 weeks invested, don't stop now), Commitment (reflection creates accountability)

**Week 4: "Building the Bridge"**

* Flow difficulty: Mastery application (everything converges)  
* EPIC element: Pride \+ Connection — Creating the first Connection Agreement  
* Peak moment: Completing a Connection Agreement that documents how they'll lead differently  
* Close: No open loop — this is the culminating moment. Close with pride and purpose.  
* Behavioral mechanic: IKEA Effect (they built this), Endowment (they own this), Goal Gradient (finish line energy)

---

## **METRICS THAT MATTER**

Track these to know if the engagement architecture is working:

**Activation Metrics:**

* Time to first insight (target: under 60 seconds)  
* Onboarding completion rate (target: 85%+)  
* First-week return rate (target: 70%+)

**Habit Metrics:**

* Weekly active rate during engagement period (target: 80%+)  
* Unprompted app opens (opens not driven by notification)  
* Average session depth (pages/insights viewed per visit)

**Transformation Metrics:**

* Tier 2 module completion rate (target: 75%+ complete all 4 weeks)  
* Connection Agreements created per leader  
* Reflection entries written (investment depth)

**Advocacy Metrics:**

* Leaders who share an insight or screenshot (organic advocacy)  
* Referral language used (do they describe the experience or the tool?)  
* Team member inquiries about Tier 2 individual path

---

## **ANTI-PATTERNS — WHAT NOT TO DO**

**Never gamify leadership development with surface mechanics.** Points, badges, and leaderboards feel insulting in a leadership context. The behavioral mechanics should be invisible. Leaders should feel *compelled*, not *played*.

**Never let the app feel like homework.** If a leader opens the app because they feel obligated (consultant told them to), engagement will die as soon as the consulting engagement ends. They must open it because they WANT to know what it shows them.

**Never surface data without interpretation.** A DISC chart means nothing to a busy leader. Every data point must be paired with a "so what" statement that connects to their lived experience: "Your team's High S composition means they need advance notice before changes — surprise announcements create anxiety, not excitement."

**Never end a session on information. End on emotion.** The last thing a leader sees before closing the app should make them feel something — pride, curiosity, connection, resolve. Not a data summary.

**Never optimize for time-in-app. Optimize for insight-per-visit.** A 90-second session where a leader gains one actionable insight is infinitely more valuable than a 15-minute session where they browse aimlessly. Depth over duration.

**Never forget: the app serves the relationship, not the other way around.** The LWYL app exists to make Daniel's consulting more impactful and to sustain transformation between sessions. If the app ever feels disconnected from the human relationship, the architecture has failed.
