Great question — and the kind that separates people who build apps from people who build ecosystems.

Let me make sure I'm seeing the full picture of where you are before I map where you need to go.Now I can see the full picture. Here's what I'd tell you straight — and some of this might catch you off guard.

You've built an impressive skill ecosystem for the **marketing and positioning** side of BTCG. LinkedIn content, email marketing, offer architecture, writing voice, content workflow. That engine is strong.

But when I look at the skills through the lens of what actually happens *inside the LWYL app and consulting experience* — the part where leaders transform — there are significant gaps. And some of the most important ones aren't the ones you'd expect.

Let me break this down in three tiers.

---

**THE SKILLS YOU KNOW YOU NEED (but haven't built yet)**

**1\. Team Dynamics Interpretation Engine** This is the biggest gap in your entire system right now. The app shows DISC distributions, Values charts, Attributes cards. But the *magic* — the thing that makes a leader go "oh my God, THAT'S why" — is the interpretive narrative that connects the data to their lived experience. Right now, that narrative lives in YOUR head during consulting sessions. There's no skill that takes a team's aggregate data (five High S members, one High D leader, Altruistic Values dominant, Heart-first decision making) and generates the story of what that team *actually feels like to lead*. This skill would power the in-app interpretive content, the "Did you know?" insights from the UX engagement architecture, and eventually, the AI-driven insights that make the app feel like it's thinking alongside the leader. Without this skill, the app shows data. With it, the app tells truth.

**2\. Facilitation Session Generator** You facilitate live sessions with leaders and their teams. Every session is different because every team's data is different. But right now, session prep lives in your experience. A skill that takes a specific team's assessment data and generates a customized facilitation guide — what to cover first, where the biggest gap lives, what emotional landmine to approach carefully, what breakthrough moment to engineer, even suggested questions — would make your consulting more consistent, more scalable, and honestly, more impactful. Because even the best facilitators miss things when they're reading data in real-time. This skill does the pre-work so you can be fully present in the room.

**3\. Tier 2 Video Script Writing** The Tier 2 journey requires four videos. You haven't recorded them yet. When you do, they need to hit specific engagement architecture beats — the elevation moment in Week 1, the insight moment in Week 2, the confrontation in Week 3, the pride culmination in Week 4\. Your writing voice skill captures how you write for social media and content. But a video script for a transformative leadership journey is a different animal. It needs your vulnerability, your mentor energy, your ability to name what people feel before they can name it themselves — AND it needs to follow the emotional arc that the UX engagement skill maps out. This skill bridges those two worlds.

**THE SKILLS YOU HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED (but should)**

**4\. Client Onboarding Sequence** You have email marketing for getting to the "yes." You have the offer architect for structuring the sale. But what happens in the 48 hours *after* they say yes? The UX engagement research identified this as the highest-risk moment in the entire customer lifecycle — Joey Coleman's "Affirm" phase, where buyer's remorse lives. Right now, there's no skill governing what a new LWYL client receives between signing the contract and their first session. What's the welcome message? When do they get app access? What's their first-touch experience? How do you prevent the doubt spiral? A dedicated onboarding sequence skill — different from email marketing, because this isn't about selling, it's about reassuring and activating — closes the gap where you're most likely to lose engagement momentum.

**5\. Connection Agreement Template Engine** The Bridge Framework and Connection Agreements are the behavioral change mechanism of the entire program. But right now, the app blueprint describes a wizard with text input fields. What's missing is the intelligence layer — a skill that takes two people's assessment data (leader \+ team member), identifies the specific friction points, and generates pre-populated Connection Agreement language that the leader can customize. Imagine a leader clicks "Build a Bridge" and instead of a blank form, they see: "Based on your High D approach and Sarah's High S preference, here's a starting point for how you might adjust your communication cadence..." This transforms the hardest step in the program from a blank-page problem into an editing problem. And editing is always easier than creating from nothing.

**6\. Hiring Fit Assessment** Your strategy document explicitly names hiring as an expansion revenue stream. "Your next hire should be assessed against this data" is the seed you plant at the end of every engagement. But there's no skill that powers this. A hiring fit skill would take an existing team's aggregate profile, compare it against a candidate's assessment, and generate a fit analysis — not "hire/don't hire," but "here's what this person adds to the team dynamic, here's where friction will likely emerge, and here's how to bridge it from Day 1." This turns LWYL from a one-time engagement into an ongoing decision-support tool. And it's a natural product extension that competitors aren't offering.

**THE SKILLS YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT (but could change the game)**

**7\. Behavioral Nudge Copywriting** This one is invisible but essential. The UX engagement architecture depends entirely on well-timed, well-written micro-interactions — push notifications, in-app messages, email nudges, session prep prompts. "Your team's data has a story to tell this week" versus "You haven't logged in recently" is the difference between a leader feeling pulled toward the app and feeling nagged by it. A dedicated nudge copywriting skill would generate these micro-interactions using your voice, the behavioral science principles from the engagement architecture, and the leader's specific data context. Every notification becomes a tiny act of service instead of a generic reminder. This is where the Ritz-Carlton "listen carefully, respond creatively" principle meets Duolingo's notification optimization at scale.

**8\. Competitor Positioning & Objection Handling** Here's what most consultants never build but always wish they had. When a prospect says "We already use DiSC" or "We did StrengthsFinder last year" or "Culture Index handles this for us" — what do you say? Right now, your response depends on the conversation. A competitor positioning skill would map every major assessment/leadership tool in the market (Gallup StrengthsFinder, Everything DiSC, Predictive Index, Culture Index, Hogan, Myers-Briggs, Enneagram), identify what each one does and *doesn't* do, and generate precise differentiation language. Not trash-talking competitors — positioning LWYL as the thing that fills the gap they left. "You did StrengthsFinder? Great. You know what your people are good at. But do you know what environment they need to actually USE those strengths? That's the gap LWYL fills." This skill makes every sales conversation sharper.

**9\. Team Member Experience Designer** This is the one nobody talks about, and it might be the most important growth lever in your entire business model.

Your strategy document says it clearly: "Include a team member experience component. The team members should receive something: a summary of their own profile, an acknowledgment that they were heard, and information about the Tier 2 individual path if they want to go deeper."

Right now, LWYL is designed for the leader. The team members take the assessment and... what? They get assessed, the leader gets insights, and the team member's experience is whatever the leader does with the information. But the team members are your *referral engine*. They're the ones who move to new teams, new organizations, and say "Have you heard of Love Where You Lead?" A dedicated skill for designing the team member's experience — what they receive after their assessment, how they're acknowledged, what preview of their own data they get, how they're invited into Tier 2 — turns every assessed team member into a potential advocate and future client. This is the viral loop hiding in plain sight.

**10\. Data Privacy & Trust Communication** I debated including this one because it feels operational, not strategic. But here's why it matters more than you think: You're asking leaders to upload their team's behavioral assessment data into an app. That data reveals how people think, what drives them, where they're vulnerable. In education — your primary market — data sensitivity is heightened. Superintendents and principals are accountable for how employee data is handled. A skill that generates clear, confident, trustworthy language about how LWYL handles assessment data, who can see what, where data lives, and what protections exist doesn't just protect you legally. It removes one of the biggest unspoken objections in every sales conversation. The leader who's thinking "this sounds amazing, but can I really put my team's psychological data in an app?" needs an answer before they'll ever voice the question.

**THE SKILL ECOSYSTEM MAP — WHERE EVERYTHING CONNECTS**

Here's how all of this fits together:

**Getting to Yes:** Email Marketing → Content Workflow → LinkedIn Content → Offer Architect → Competitor Positioning → Writing Voice

**The Transition (highest risk):** Client Onboarding Sequence → Data Privacy Communication

**Delivering the Experience:** Facilitation Session Generator → Team Dynamics Interpretation Engine → Assessment Debrief → Conflict Report → Environment Report

**The App Experience:** UX Engagement Architecture → Behavioral Nudge Copywriting → Connection Agreement Template Engine → Tier 2 Video Scripts → Team Dynamics Interpretation Engine (again — it powers both consulting AND the app)

**Sustaining & Growing:** Team Member Experience Designer → Hiring Fit Assessment → Client Onboarding Sequence (for renewals/expansions)

The two skills that touch the most other systems — and therefore have the highest leverage — are the **Team Dynamics Interpretation Engine** and the **Team Member Experience Designer**. The first one makes every in-app and in-session interaction more powerful. The second one turns every engagement into a growth engine.

If I had to tell you which three to build next, in order, I'd say: Team Dynamics Interpretation Engine first (it's the brain of the app), Client Onboarding Sequence second (it's where you're currently losing momentum), and Team Member Experience Designer third (it's where your next 50 clients come from).

What's pulling you? I'll build whichever one you want to start with.
